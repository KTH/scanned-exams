/**
 * Brief explanation about assignments in Canvas.
 *
 * All assignments in Canvas can have three date fields which are called:
 * `unlock_date`, `lock_date` and `due_at`.
 *
 * In general, those dates are defined as follow:
 * - range between `unlock_date` and `lock_date` represents the period of time
 *   where the assignment is "open" and can receive submissions.
 * - `due_at`: when someone sends a submission after this date, the submission
 *   is marked as "LATE"
 *
 * For safety reasons, we want to:
 * - be able to upload scanned exams to an assignment
 * - not allow students to upload things to the same assignment.
 *
 * The Canvas API for submissions, however, has the following rules:
 * - The assignment must be "open" to be able to upload scanned exams (current
 *   date must be between `unlock_date` and `lock_date`)
 * - If the assignment is "open", students can also upload things
 * - When using a token with teacher permissions, it is possible to write
 *   manually the "submission date", meaning that we can force the submission to
 *   not be marked as "LATE".
 *
 * Conclusions are:
 * - When uploading an exam, we "unlock" it for the shortest possible period of
 *   time. That lowers the risk of students uploading their submissions.
 * - Create the assignment with "due_at" date equal to the examination date.
 *   That ensures that students submissions are marked as "LATE" even in the
 *   strange case where they could upload something during the "unlock" period.
 *
 * This module contains all the properties to create an assignment, unlock it,
 * lock it, and send submissions correctly
