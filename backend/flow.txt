Flow:

1. User enters the application from Canvas.
2. User completes the oauth process.
   We get from Canvas:
   - Access Token
   - User Identity
   - Course ID
3. Create a map with the entry:
   key: Access Token
   value: { courseId, userId }

ENDPOINT /api/
- Given the Access Token
- Get the course Id from the map
- Fetch a list of all assignments in Canvas inside that course Id
- Get the asignment that has the "integration data" = {courseCode, examCode, examDate}
- If the assignment exists return:

{
  assignment: {
    id: 121223,
    name: "Name of the assignment",
    published: true,
    link: "https://....."
  },
  state:
    | "idle"           // No one has ever imported scanned exams with this app
    | "preparing"      // (fetching a list from the TentaAPI, checking that the assignment is available in Canvas)
    | "downloading"    // downloading every PDF from the TentaAPI
    | "publishing"     // publishing the Canvas assignment
    | "uploading"      // uploading every PDF to Canvas
    | "unpublishing"   // unpublishing the Canvas assignment
    | "success"        // there was a previous attempt that went correctly
    | "error"          // the last attempt didn't go well
  progress: {
    totalExams: 120,
    downloadedExams: 12,
    uploadedExams: 0
  },
  error: {
    message: "Something went wrong"
  }
}

}

ENDPOINT POST /upload
- Given the Access Token
- Get the course ID
- Canvas.getValidAssignment(courseId) -> Assignment ID, courseCode, examCode, examDate
