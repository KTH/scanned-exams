## Vocabulary

These are common words and phrases that should be used in the app for UX consistency.

- KTH Import Exams? -- name of app (don't use: scanned exams?)
- Exam room -- The Canvas course where the app is installed and run. An exam room is one-to-one mapped to an aktivitetstillf√§lle in Ladok. (_don't_ use Course since that means something entirely different in Ladok. Don't use courseroom either, since that is something different.)
